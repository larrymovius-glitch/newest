# Cross-App Integration Guide

## System Overview

Three apps that work together:
1. **EZ AD Creator** (this app) — AI video generator + product catalog + store feed
2. **Affiliate Pro** — Affiliate marketing management
3. **amhere4utoday.com** — Customer-facing store

## How They Connect

```
EZ AD Creator (Central Hub)
    ├── /api/store/feed (PUBLIC) ──→ amhere4utoday.com reads published products
    ├── /api/external/products (SECURED) ──→ Affiliate Pro reads/writes products
    └── /api/external/videos (SECURED) ──→ Affiliate Pro reads completed videos
```

## For the amhere4utoday.com Store Agent

### What to tell the agent:

> "My product data comes from an external API. Fetch products from this URL and display them as store items. Each product has a name, description, price, affiliate link, and promo videos."

### Store Feed Endpoint (PUBLIC — no authentication needed):

```
GET https://ad-creator-hub-4.preview.emergentagent.com/api/store/feed
```

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Health Supplement Bundle",
      "description": "Premium vitamins...",
      "affiliate_link": "https://...",
      "price": 49.99,
      "category": "Health & Wellness",
      "image_url": "https://...",
      "promo_videos": [
        {
          "id": "video-uuid",
          "prompt": "Video description",
          "video_url": "/api/videos/{id}/download",
          "duration": 4,
          "size": "1280x720"
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "2026-03-06T...",
      "updated_at": "2026-03-06T..."
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### How the store should use this:
1. On page load, fetch from the store feed URL
2. Display each product as a store item (name, description, price)
3. The `affiliate_link` is the "Buy Now" button destination
4. If `promo_videos` exist, embed them on the product page
5. Video download URL: `https://ad-creator-hub-4.preview.emergentagent.com{video_url}`

### Single product endpoint:
```
GET https://ad-creator-hub-4.preview.emergentagent.com/api/store/feed/{product_id}
```
